Core Data Managed Objects and Core Data Manager Object for Beach Havoc Game
This is the Model Code only. Sorry! The rest of the game code is proprietary. This is to illustrate a simple Core Data model.
Although a game is way more complicated logically than most business apps, a games data model is quite simple.
